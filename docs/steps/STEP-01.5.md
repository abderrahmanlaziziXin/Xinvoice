# STEP 01.5 - Batch Invoice Processing

**Date**: September 5, 2025  
**Status**: Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Enhanced the document generation MVP with advanced batch processing capabilities, allowing users to create multiple invoices simultaneously with AI-powered generation using GPT-4o.

## What Was Built

### 1. AI Model Upgrade
- **Upgraded from GPT-4o-mini to GPT-4o**
  - Enhanced batch processing capabilities
  - Better understanding of complex multi-document requests
  - Improved consistency across batch operations

### 2. Enhanced LLM Provider (`/packages/core/llm-provider.ts`)
- **New Interface Method**: `generateBatchDocuments(prompts[], documentType, userContext)`
- **OpenAI Implementation**:
  - Batch system prompt optimized for multiple document generation
  - Single API call for all prompts to maintain consistency
  - Unique invoice numbering (INV-001, INV-002, etc.)
- **Gemini Implementation**:
  - Batch processing support with consistent system prompt
  - JSON response parsing for multiple documents
  - Fallback handling for various response formats

### 3. Batch API Endpoint (`/app/api/generate-batch/route.ts`)
- **Request Schema**: Accepts array of prompts + document type + user context
- **Response Schema**: Returns array of validated documents with count
- **Features**:
  - Individual document validation with detailed error reporting
  - Email field cleaning (same as single generation)
  - Comprehensive error handling for batch operations

### 4. Batch Generation Hook (`/app/hooks/use-generate-batch-documents.ts`)
- **TanStack Query Integration**: Optimistic updates and error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for requests/responses
- **Error Management**: Detailed error logging and user feedback

### 5. Batch Invoice Page (`/app/(app)/new/invoice-batch/page.tsx`)
- **Multi-Input Interface**:
  - Dynamic add/remove input fields
  - Real-time validation of prompt count
  - Smart processing: single ‚Üí normal API, multiple ‚Üí batch API
- **Bulk Management Features**:
  - Generated invoice overview with key details
  - Individual editing capability for each invoice
  - Bulk download preparation (framework ready)
  - Consistent company branding across all invoices
- **UI/UX Enhancements**:
  - Gradient design matching app theme
  - Loading states for batch operations
  - Clear separation between input and editing phases

### 6. Navigation Updates (`/app/page.tsx`)
- **Home Page Options**:
  - "Create Single Invoice" - existing workflow
  - "Create Batch Invoices" - new batch workflow
  - Clear visual distinction between options

## Key Features Implemented

### üöÄ Batch Processing
- **Multiple Prompts**: Add unlimited invoice requests
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically chooses single vs batch API
- **Unique Numbering**: Each invoice gets unique sequential numbers
- **Consistent Branding**: Company settings applied to all invoices

### ‚úèÔ∏è Bulk Editing
- **Individual Sections**: Each invoice in its own editable section
- **Quick Overview**: Key details visible without editing
- **Inline Editing**: Simple editing interface for quick changes
- **Save Management**: Individual save operations per invoice

### üé® Enhanced UI
- **Multi-Phase Interface**: Input ‚Üí Generation ‚Üí Editing ‚Üí Download
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear status of batch operations
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for failed generations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Type Safety
```typescript
interface GenerateBatchDocumentRequest {
  prompts: string[]
  documentType: DocumentType
  userContext?: UserContext
}

interface GenerateBatchDocumentResponse {
  success: boolean
  documents: Invoice[]
  count: number
  error?: string
}
```

### 2. Error Handling
- Individual document validation with specific error messages
- Batch operation failure handling
- User-friendly error display with retry options

### 3. Performance
- Single API call for entire batch (vs multiple individual calls)
- Optimized validation pipeline
- Memory-efficient document storage

## Usage Examples

### Single Invoice Request
```
Input: "Invoice ACME Corp $2500 for website development, due in 30 days"
Result: Uses /api/generate (existing single endpoint)
```

### Batch Invoice Requests
```
Input: 
1. "Invoice ACME Corp $2500 for website development, due in 30 days"
2. "Invoice XYZ Company $1200 for logo design, due in 15 days"
3. "Invoice Tech Solutions $3500 for mobile app, due in 45 days"

Result: Uses /api/generate-batch (new batch endpoint)
Output: 3 invoices with numbers INV-001, INV-002, INV-003
```
