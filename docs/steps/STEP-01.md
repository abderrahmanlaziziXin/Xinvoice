# STEP 01 - Invoice Editor

**Date**: September 5, 2025  
**Status**: Complete ✅

## Objective
Implement a complete invoice editing interface with AI generation, React Hook Form validation, and live calculations.

## What was built

### 1. TanStack Query Setup
- Created `QueryProvider` component for React Query integration
- Updated root layout to wrap the app with query provider
- Configured default options for queries (stale time, retry logic)

### 2. Invoice Generation Hook
`/app/hooks/use-generate-document.ts`:
- Created custom hook using `useMutation` from TanStack Query
- Handles API calls to `/api/generate` endpoint
- Error handling and loading states
- TypeScript interfaces for request/response types

### 3. Invoice Form Component
`/app/components/invoice-form.tsx`:
- Comprehensive form using React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Live Calculations**: Automatic subtotal, tax, and total calculation
- **Field Array Management**: Dynamic add/remove items
- **Real-time Updates**: useEffect triggers on quantity/rate changes
- Sections:
  - Header information (invoice number, dates)
  - From/To party details
  - Dynamic items list with quantity × rate = amount
  - Tax calculation with configurable rate
  - Terms and notes
  - Live totals display

### 4. Invoice Creation Page
`/app/(app)/new/invoice/page.tsx`:
- Two-phase interface: prompt input → form editing
- **Prompt Input Phase**:
  - Large textarea for natural language input
  - Sample prompts for user guidance
  - Loading state with spinner during generation
  - Error handling display
- **Form Editing Phase**:
  - Loads generated data into InvoiceForm
  - "Start Over" functionality
  - Save button (placeholder for PDF in Step 02)

### 5. Navigation Updates
- Updated home page with "Create Invoice" button
- Added legal disclaimer
- Disabled "Create NDA" button (coming in Step 03)

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Live Totals Calculation
- Automatic calculation of item amounts (quantity × rate)
- Real-time subtotal updates
- Tax amount calculation based on configurable rate
- Final total calculation
- Read-only amount fields that update automatically

### ✅ React Hook Form Integration
- Zod schema validation for all fields
- Field arrays for dynamic items management
- Error display for validation failures
- Form state management with default values

### ✅ AI Generation Flow
1. User enters natural language prompt
2. API call to `/api/generate` with documentType: 'invoice'
3. Generated JSON data populates form fields
4. User can edit and refine the invoice
5. Form validation ensures data integrity

### ✅ User Experience
- Loading states during AI generation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Sample prompts for guidance
- Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Progressive disclosure (prompt → form)

## File Structure
```
app/
├── components/
│   ├── query-provider.tsx       # TanStack Query setup
│   └── invoice-form.tsx         # Main invoice form component
├── hooks/
│   └── use-generate-document.ts # API integration hook
├── (app)/new/invoice/
│   └── page.tsx                 # Invoice creation page
├── layout.tsx                   # Updated with QueryProvider
└── page.tsx                     # Updated home page
```

## Technical Details

### Form Validation
- Zod schema validation for all invoice fields
- Required field validation (name, invoice number, etc.)
- Number validation for quantities, rates, tax rates
- Email validation for contact fields

### Calculations Logic
```typescript
// Triggered on item or tax rate changes
const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => 
  sum + (item.quantity * item.rate), 0)
const taxAmount = subtotal * taxRate
const total = subtotal + taxAmount
```

### State Management
- React Hook Form for form state
- TanStack Query for server state
- Local state for UI phases (prompt vs form)

## Testing Instructions
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3001
3. Click "Create Invoice"
4. Enter prompt: "Invoice ACME Corp $1500 for web design, due in 14 days"
5. Click "Generate Draft"
6. Verify form populates with generated data
7. Test live calculations by changing quantities/rates
8. Add/remove items to test dynamic arrays

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- [x] Prompt input interface with "Generate Draft" button
- [x] API integration returning JSON data to populate form
- [x] Editable form with all invoice fields
- [x] Live totals calculation (quantity × rate = amount)
- [x] Add/remove items functionality
- [x] Validation with inline error messages
- [x] Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Loading states and error handling

## Next Step
Proceed to STEP 02 - PDF Export functionality.
