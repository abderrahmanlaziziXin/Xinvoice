- [x] Ensure consistent company branding across all batch invoices
- [x] Smart processing: single request â†’ normal API, multiple â†’ batch API
- [x] **File Upload System**: CSV/Excel file upload with intelligent AI parsing
- [x] **Universal Format Support**: Handle any CSV/Excel format (bank exports, accounting systems)
- [x] **Dual Input Modes**: Toggle between text input and file upload for both single and batch
- [x] **Smart File Processing**: AI interprets uploaded data and generates appropriate invoices
