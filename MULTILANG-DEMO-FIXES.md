2. Add multiple prompts for different invoices
3. Click "Generate Batch"
4. **Expected Result**:
   - All documents generate successfully
   - Batch statistics display correctly
   - Individual PDF downloads work for each document

## 🐛 Debug Features

### **Console Logging**
The demo includes comprehensive console logging:
- `🚀 Starting generation...` - Initial request
- `✅ Generation result:` - API response
- `📋 Final mapped result:` - Processed data
- `🎯 Document ready for form:` - Form-ready data

### **Visual Debug Panels**
- Raw API response viewers in expandable sections
- Data mapping status indicators
- Form compatibility checks
- Error details with actionable solutions

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

**Issue**: Form doesn't load after generation
- **Check**: Console for data mapping logs
- **Solution**: Verify API response contains expected fields
- **Debug**: Use raw data viewer to inspect response structure

**Issue**: PDF download fails
- **Check**: Document type (only invoices support full PDF)
- **Solution**: Ensure document data is properly formatted
- **Debug**: Check console for PDF generation errors

**Issue**: Settings don't save
- **Check**: Browser console for persistence errors
- **Solution**: Verify localStorage is enabled
- **Debug**: Check CompanySettings component for validation errors

## 📊 Performance Optimizations
